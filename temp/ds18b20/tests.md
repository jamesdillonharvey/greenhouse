### 2 Amps - 7.7v
  - egg from fridge
  - water to line
  - 7:00 - 14.65 - target 75
  - 9:30 - 75  - target 63
  - 10:15 - 63
  
2 amps is too slow
nice white, dry and hard yolk


### 3.5 - 13.8v
  - egg from fridge
  - water to line
  - 10:20 - 21.75 - target 75
  - 11:00 - 75 - target 63
  - 11:40 - 63
  
nice white, hard yolk, not as hard as 2 Amps  

### 5A - 9.3v - 2 heaters parallel
  - egg from fridge
  - water to line
  - 2 heaters at bottom
  - sensor touching top of egg.
  - **lid off**
  - 12:16 - 23C - target 75C
  - 13:02 - 75C - target 63C
  - 13:21 - 66C - opened
  
very nice white, hard yolk

### Conclusion

 - Need to get to yolk temperature first
 - Then fast heat up white (less water)
 - Then cool rapidly (Heat sync with Fan maybe)
